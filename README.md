# CNN-LSTM-Radiology-Image-and-Report
Deep learning model using both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in order to analyze image and provide report to aid medical professionals.

## Workflow 

Using the following strategy we implemeted both CNN and LSTM in order to not only detect images but also provide automated reports to go along with the trained model.
